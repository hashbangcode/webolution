Webolution
==========

An experimental set of classes that attempts to put together an application that will evolve a webpage. This is intended
to be a test application that allows me to learn the techniques involved in genetic algorithms as well as how to to
put together a modern PHP application with composer. As a result things might change significantly without warning.


The following data structures are used here:

- Core data classes that provide the data components.
- Individual classes that allow mution and fitness testing of the core class data structures.
- Population classes that allow individual classes to be collected together and sorted.
- A main evolution class that allows the populations to be managed by generation.

The following tasks will form part of this:

- Number evolution (done).
- Text evolution (done).
- Colour evolution (done).
- HTML Element evolution (done).
- Style evolution (done).
- Full page evoluion (done).
